# yummy-race

Yummy Race is a silly 2d world game written in C, implementing ncurses library (which is why it may be a bit faulty if the user's OS isn't some Linux distro). The gist of the game is that both user and computer try to collect points and after certain time limit (which is user-customizable) is up, player who gained the most points wins. The game even implements AI used in the most top-notch AAA games - whenever the computer runs into a wall, a simple if statement is considered for the computer's next direction, and so the Human Player stands a real chance in this grand challenge. It's a silly, simple game, but it was fun to make it work. The image below displays the visuals of the game for all the non-Linux users.
